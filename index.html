            <dt><h3>The whole story in Summary.....</h3></dt>
            <dd>Waking up everyday very early in the morning at the begining was always very stressful but along run it became part of me. The first day i started i told myself i was going to be giving a self report everyday, 
                but the very first day as i was giving the report it began to pall, i became less interested. It was very funny, but after the second day and the third, with the determination and grit i was able to patiently listen to myself. after the third day things were going normally although sometimes i feel tired but there is this spirit in me thaat tells me, wake up bro! its getting late.
                I am happy i could challenge myself and see myself succeed. All thanks to God! <br>
